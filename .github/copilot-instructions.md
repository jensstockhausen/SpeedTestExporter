# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a Python project for a speed exporter that runs in a virtual environment.

## Development Setup
- Python virtual environment is located in `.venv/`
- Dependencies are managed in `requirements.txt`, dependencies are defined including the exact versions.
- Activate the environment with: `source .venv/bin/activate`

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

## Project Structure
- `speed_exporter.py` - Main script with entry point in `main()` function
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
- `.venv/` - Virtual environment (not committed to git)

## Best Practices
- Test code before committing
- Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date
- Handle errors gracefully
- Add appropriate logging for debugging
